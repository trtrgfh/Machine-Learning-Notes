## Supervised Learning <a name="supervisedlearning"></a>
Supervised learning is where given labeled data which is like given a set of questions and their corresponding answers, and then write algorithms that learn from the “right answer”.

### Linear Regression <a name="linearregression"></a>
Linear regression Is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The function is in the form $f(x^{i}) = wx^{i} + b$ and it will fit the data in a straight line.

### Logistic Regression <a name="logisticregression"></a>
Logistic regression is used for classification.
Start with using the linear regression model, $f(x^{i}) = wx^{i} + b$, to predict y given x. Then, substitute the result from the linear regression function into sigmoid function which would map all inputs to values from 0 to 1.

## Unsupervised Learning <a name="unsupervisedlearning"></a>
unsupervised learning is where given unlabeled data and then the algorithms automatically find patterns in the data and make them into groups.
